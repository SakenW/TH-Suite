## Placeholder Implementation

Currently using silent placeholder files. To add real sounds:

1. Download Minecraft sound effects or create custom ones
2. Convert to OGG format (recommended for web compatibility)
3. Keep file sizes under 50KB for quick loading
4. Ensure volume is normalized

## License

Ensure all sound files comply with applicable licenses.
